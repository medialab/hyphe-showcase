This project aims to explore and analyze the **different forms of data regulation** such as law, social, code and market (Lessig, 2000).

It tries to understand the role that actors like insurance companies may have to manage risks and act as a third party in the context of development of personal data transactions and the rise of data breaches.

The main issues consist in understanding how insurance can build trust and enable Big Data. The full project mobilizes different approaches, from use case, to text analysis, ethnographic study and also web analysis.
