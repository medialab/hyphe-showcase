This project aims to explore and analyze the **different forms of data regulation** such as law, social, code and market (Lessig, 2000).

It tries to understand the role that actors like insurance companies may have to manage risks and act as a third party in the context of development of personal data transactions and the rise of data breaches. The main issues consist in understanding how insurance can build trust and enable Big Data. The full project mobilizes different approaches, from use case, to text analysis, ethnographic study and also web analysis.

Controversy mapping on the web is based on web crawls and textual and graph analysis of the various web entities contributing to the issue of personal data and risk. In this module we are looking for insights on the perception of personal data risks coming from ordinary people on blogs, forums and social networks as well as media or experts.

The Privacy datascape can be defined as a structured dataset of web pages tagged with topics and topological attributes, also an interactive interface for users to search and navigate the dataset and filter information. A tool to explore and extract qualitative data for further investigations.

The final dataset is a network of 7,578 web entities composed comprising over 380,000 web pages. The Web entities are linked by 50,904 hyperlinks
Please note that 2,256 web entities have no link between them and the core component of the network. They do not appear on the map but their web pages are indexed and accessible by the search engine.
